## Project Description
__Data Set__ : Bechdel Tests of movies from [FiveThirtyEight] (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/f/blob/master/bechdel/movies.csv)

##### Background of Data Set
This data was collected by FiveThirtyEight. There is not much information available from them about the dataset. We accessed it using FiveThirtyEight's github folder full of public .csv (_c_omma _s_eparated _v_alue) files.
##### What is a Bechdel Test?
According to [bechdeltest.com](http://bechdeltest.com/), the Bechdel Test, sometimes called the _Mo Movie Measure_ or _Bechdel Rule_ is a simple test which names the following three criteria: (1) it has to have at least two women in it, who (2) who talk to each other, about (3) something besides a man. The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic _Dykes to Watch Out For_, in a 1985 strip called _The Rule_. 

The Bechdel Test has since become relatively well known and is often referenced in movie reviews. It has become a rather embarassing test to fail, though many movies do fail it. 

#### Audiences for this project
Our main audience are people who are critical of movies that fail the Bechdel Test and are interested in learning what trends there are in movies being better or worse at the test.
